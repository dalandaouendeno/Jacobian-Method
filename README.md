# Jacobian-Method
Jacobian Method problem solving

 """
    f: a vector of functions
    x: a n (>1) dimensional vector, where f(x) is evaluated.
    dx: a finite change in the given point
    method: use central-difference approximation by default;
            use forward-difference approximation if method=0
            use backward-difference approximation if method=1
